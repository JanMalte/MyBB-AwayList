Awaylist - MyBB Plugin

This plugin provides a list where members can subscribe when they are at a
special place.
The list include when the journey begins and when it ends. Also some additional
informations can be displayed.

Please uninstall any previous version to make sure there are no old changes left.
The database table can be left, as it still uses the old data.
